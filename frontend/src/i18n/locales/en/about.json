    "heading": "From Paper to Platform",
    "p1": "Quiniela was born out of a weekly tradition in a bustling workplace where a group of Mexican friends shared more than just a shift—they shared a passion for football. Every week, the crew would gather to organize a friendly and fun Liga MX match prediction pool every week, meticulously handwriting match schedules, predictions, and scores on sheets of paper.",
    "p2": "While the \"pen and paper\" method carried a certain nostalgic charm, it was prone to lost slips, handwriting disputes, and the tedious manual calculation of points."
